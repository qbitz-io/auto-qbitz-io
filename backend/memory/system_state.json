This ensures that documentation syncing and self-improvement tasks are triggered automatically after orchestrator operations.\n\nI have also generated asynchronous pytest-based tests for the SelfImproverAgent in backend/tests/test_self_improver.py to verify basic improve method functionality with and without additional context.\n\nNext steps:\n- You can run the tests with pytest to verify the SelfImproverAgent behavior.\n- The orchestrator will now automatically trigger self-improvement tasks including documentation syncing after its main run.\n\nIf you want me to run the tests or perform any other actions, please let me know.",
