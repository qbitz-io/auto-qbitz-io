After Auto lobotomized itself by replacing the orchestrator\nand API with stubs, this adds a guardian layer to write_file that\nqueues changes to 17 protected files for human review via API.\n\n- New: backend/core/file_guardian.py \\(protection logic + approval queue\\)\n- Modified: write_file tool checks guardian before any write\n- New API endpoints: /api/approvals \\(list/review/approve/deny changes\\)\n- Forbidden paths \\(.env, .git\\) are always blocked\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
